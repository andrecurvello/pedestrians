Pedestrians is a simulator for pedestrian movement. It's fun, it's light, it's a tech demo at this point.

As of July 2011, the project has been in development for barely more than a month. Here's a basic rundown of what the project currently does:
1. Launch it with "StartPedestrians.class"
2. A number of pedestrians are randomly generated and placed around the world.
3. The world is full of randomly placed obstacles (red blocks)
4. Pedestrians avoid running into/through these blocks, as well as other pedestrians

The project is being built with all three major desktop OS's in mind: Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.
