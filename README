Pedestrians is a simulator for pedestrian movement. It's fun, it's light, it's a tech demo at this point.

As of June 2011, the project has been in development for a week. It doesn't do much right now. You can launch "StartPedestrians.class", and you'll see a single pedestrian. You can click on any point on the screen, and the pedestrian will move there. Hold down your mouse and draw a path around the screen; the pedestrian will follow that path.

The project is being built for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows.
